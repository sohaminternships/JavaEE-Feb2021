Welcome to Soham's Work from Home Internships. This is an initial qualifying module. This has to be developed by each group individually. You will have to complete this module within 15 days from date of allotment. First module final github upload date is 5 March 2021.

Upload all the code on your github repository so that we can track your progress. After completion of this small module, Our projects coordinator Megha ma'am will evaluate your coding standards and development level. We will assign a MVC project module with higher complexity and more functionalities.
